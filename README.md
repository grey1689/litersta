Unstructured text is no match for Litersta
Working with text now becomes effortless when paired with Litersta textual analytics software.

Unlike database fields, which are easily queried, text contains unstructured data that must be parsed for key objects that can be transformed in to powerful metrics.

Litersta - textual analytics - software leverages statistical algorithms to programmatically locate, and extract, overall document sentiment, word frequencies, and document similarities.

The Litersta web application runs locally on your server - behind your firewall. This strategy keeps your data confidential and secure.
