<br>
Litersta - textual analytics - software leverages statistical algorithms to programmatically locate, and extract, overall document sentiment, word frequencies, and document similarities.<br>
<br>
## Software Abilities
<b>Similarity Scoring</b><br>
Similarity scoring is used to locate text documents that are similar to a selected few. A small subset of documents is chosen and each document within the subset is scored based on its similarity to the documents in the population.<br>
<br>
<b>Machine Learning</b><br>
Normalization, categorization, and clustering are used when preparing text for similarity scoring and sentiment analysis.<br>
<br>
<b>Word Frequency</b><br>
The frequency feature is used to locate common words across a selected document set. After the removal of stop words, 5000 words with the highest frequencies are collected from each document. The frequencies from each document are added, and a report that lists the sum of the frequencies is created.<br>
<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
Litersta runs locally, behind your firewall, to make sure that all data is kept safe and secure.<br>
<br>
<b>Data Stors and Categories</b><br>
Data stors are created and are linked to categories. A data stor may be linked to multiple categories; however, a category will never be linked to multiple data stors.<br>
<br>
<b>Sentiment Analysis</b><br>
The text from each document in a data stor category is parsed - positive and negative terms counted - and a report is generated that lists the number of positive and negative terms.<br>
